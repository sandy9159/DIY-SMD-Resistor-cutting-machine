Hello friends in this video I will make a Automatic SMD resistor cutting machine.
those who daily deals with smd comoponents knows the struggle of cutting such small resistors.
and if you need to cut them in bulk them job is even harder.

for that reason I made a mini compact machine that can cut n numbers of resistors for you.

First i have used my homemade CNC router machine to cut the acrylic parts.

I have used 6mm cast Acrylic sheet because they are router friendly and easy to machine.
I made two parts here one for stepper motor mount and one for DC gear motor mount.

Then I cut the 12mm wooden sheet to make the based of machine. I also attached 4 rubber legs the the base to reduce any mechanical vibration
here I have used two 20x20 Alu. extrusion profile. one I place horizontally ans on vertically.

On horizontal one I will attached stepper motor and on vertical one Resistor reel has been attached.

Stepper motor attached to the smaller acrylic part and DC gear motor is attached to the bigger acrylic part.

Now here I have choosen the MGH9N means 9mm linear rails which the best option for such purpose
I have screw the rail vertially to the DC gear motor acrylic part.

This are some 3D printed parts used to slide the resistor reel to the cutter blade and to hold cutter blade along with linear rails.

At last I completed the wiring thanks to the custom pcb is very quick and neat and clean also.

I attached stepper motor DC motor and HMI to its ports and now we are readyfor the action
